# MetaLand
## Inspiration
When we are studying virtual assets we faced a problem that there is not a single platform where we can access assets from multiple sellers that's why we build METALAND so that world can assess this easily 

## What it does
We provide a One stop solution for dealing the virtual assets available on all the MetaVerse platform.

## How we built it
We build website(using Wallet Connect,Wagmi,reactjs, solidity(backend)) and Mobile Application ( XML , Java , ActivityLayouts , Fragments ) from scratch .


## Challenges we ran into
Only challenge was time constraints, in a tight schedule ,we were able to submit make a prototype.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
In such a tight schedule we were able to pull off such a good website and an app.
Our team worked very well with good productivity and efficiency.
And we gained an amazing amount of experience in the field.

## What we learned
We learned time management, we got to know our full potential as we really pushed hard.
We also learned more about web3 , MetaVerse and website/app dev.


## What's next for MetaLand
We are looking forwarding to collaborating with big giant like META, DECENTRALAND,etc.
We are going to add more features in our application like introducing NFTs and add more MetaVerse platforms like META, NVIDIA etc.
